                Greeting everyone, my name is Lu Han-Yun, and my English name is Julian. I am major in department of economics. The motivation
                that I choose this course is due to the interest of web applications and the principle of JavaScript.
                I have learned some programming languages such as R and C/C++, but not very dig in to them very well.
                Then I found that web programming are more attractive to me than other programming language, by this chance,
                I hope I can enjoy this course as much as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                And also I want to practicing my English writing and reading skills since I have been a period of time
                without writing any English article.
                On the other hand, I study Japanese for interest during this three years, and I hope I came
                use this skill, maybe, to build a trilingual web or something in the future.
                That must be pretty cool.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beside Web Design, I also interest in digital art, like making illustration by using Clip Studio Paint.
                And recently I also want to learn some software about 3D model like Blender to help building my art works.
