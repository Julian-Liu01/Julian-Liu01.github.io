                Mental illness has became more and more common in modern society, many people may suffering from anxiety or depression.
                The physiology explain is that your brain does not function well as normal, may cause by stress like family or job issues.
                Take anxiety for example, there is a receptor called amygdala, which responds to fear and other kind of intensive emotion. When we are facing a highly tense situation,
                our amygdala will be stimulated and raise your respond for negative emotion, which will also slow down our frontal lobe, the brain part that let
                us making a calm and logical decision. That is what happened in our brain when someone is suffering from anxiety.
            </p>
            <p>
                Is there any way to handle with anxiety without medicine therapy? Yes, recent research has confirmed that by regular practicing meditation, we can
                effectively control anxiety an help patient maintain stable emotion state and ability to make clear decision. To practice meditation, we
                first find a quiet and safe place, sit down and strengthen our back, and close eyes. Then keep doing diaphragmatic breathing under the rhythm
                of below:"three seconds in deep breath, hold it for a second, and then take six seconds out and hold it for a second." By focus on this particular
                breath style, you brain will switch into a relaxation mode and activate your frontal lobe, and inhibit amygdala, which will make your mind feel more
                clear and peaceful, which not only useful for patient but normal people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beside physiology, what can we say about mental illness? There is a simple description about anxiety base on psychology and psychological counseling.
                That is, we find that things doesn't happen as the way we assume they should be. And this cognition difference between mind and reality may let us lose
                the sense of security, and by the complex emotion interact with imagination, we create a little drama in our mind, which exaggerate the seriousness of
                reality. Although real world may not be as awful as we think, but emotionally we tend to believe things is going to became horrible.
                One purpose of meditation is try to tell yourself everything will be fine as long as you put yourself into a relax, comfortable and quiet atmosphere
                by focus on deep and peaceful breathing.Then since you start to calm down, you will look everything happened around you clearly and know how to deal with
                problems wisely.
            </p>
            <p>
                During COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have experience very hard time to control public health and keep economic growth at the same time.
                But mental health also have huge influence of humanity, even in the normal day, because we can only making a wise decision if we
                have clear and rational mind. So it is time for us to pay more attention to our mental hygiene and looking for more easy way to keep
                our mind away from mental illness. Meditation is an easy and non-medical method for us to achieve peaceful life and healthy mind.
                I hope all of you can give it a try.
