                    If you're feeling anxious and depressed right now, you're not alone.
                    Psychological distress, depression and anxiety were <span class="vocab">prevalent<span><b>"prevalent"</b>- most frequent or common</span></span> among both men and women half a year into the Covid-19 pandemic and well beyond the initial lockdown periods, according to a new paper published Thursday in Lancet Regional Health-Americas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The study used data on 2,359 adults, a subset of participants nationwide who were enrolled in the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study-3. The researchers compared data between two different time periods -- 2018 and July through September 2020 -- to characterize levels of psychological distress.
                    <span class="joint">&#9658;</span>
                    They found that 42% of people in the study reported experiencing some mild psychological distress in the pandemic in 2020, compared to only 32% in 2018. Ten percent of 2020 study participants had some moderate-to-severe anxiety or depression. And depression was more common in those with pre-existing health conditions, like cancer.

                    Emotions can slip into anxiety and depression when negative feelings don't go away after a short period of time, said Dr. Cynthia Ackrill, a <span class="vocab">certified<span><b>"certified"</b>- proved; guaranteed</span></span> stress mastery educator.
                    <span class="joint">&#9658;</span>
                    "If the worry is intrusive beyond the stressor, that's anxiety," said Ackrill, who was not involved in the study. "If the sadness is a mood that you can't shift beyond the situation, that's depression."

                    The researchers also found women were more likely than men to report higher psychological distress during the pandemic -- especially anxiety.
                    <span class="joint">&#9658;</span>
                    Women tend to be the household caretakers, even when gender roles are more balanced than they were in the past, said John Duffy, a clinical psychologist and family therapist in Chicago, who was not involved in the study.
                    <span class="joint">&#9658;</span>
                    "They take on not only their fears, concerns and anxieties, but also those around them," Duffy said.
                    <span class="joint">&#9658;</span>
                    Higher psychological distress before the pandemic was associated with higher levels of distress during the pandemic.

                <p>
                    They found that for men, <span class="vocab">elevated<span><b>"elevated"</b>- raised above the ground</span></span> psychological distress before the pandemic was associated with an 11-fold increase in depression. That compared to a 6-fold increase in depression for women who had elevated psychological distress before the pandemic.
                    <span class="joint">&#9658;</span>
                    "Higher levels of work/life balance stressors were more strongly associated with depression for women and anxiety for men; however higher levels of financial stressors were more strongly associated with depression among men," the researchers wrote.
                    <span class="joint">&#9658;</span>
                    During the pandemic, one or more financial stressors was associated with more than double the odds of psychological distress.

                    The researchers said their findings <span class="vocab">underscore<span><b>"underscore"</b>- give extra weight to</span></span> the need for regular mental health assessment by health care professionals.
                    <span class="joint">&#9658;</span>
                    Mindful meditation can help people who are feeling stressed, said Dr. Alfiee Breland-Noble, psychologist and founder of the AAKOMA Project, a youth mental health nonprofit.
                    <span class="joint">&#9658;</span>
                    A technique she recommended involves using your five senses to identify things you can see, hear, taste, smell, touch and then something you are grateful for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The focus it takes to list each of these things is often just enough focus to move our minds off what is stressing us and into the moment," said Breland-Noble, who was not involved in the study.
                    <span class="joint">&#9658;</span>
                    It's also important to engage in activities you used to enjoy before you felt distressed and set aside <span class="vocab">dedicated<span><b>"dedicated"</b>- devoted to a cause or ideal or purpose</span></span> time for self-care, Duffy said.
                    <span class="joint">&#9658;</span>
                    Some examples of self-care include journaling, walking with a friend or watching a favorite television show, he said.
                    <span class="joint">&#9658;</span>
                    If anyone continues to struggle with their mental health, Duffy recommended they seek professional mental health support such as counseling.
