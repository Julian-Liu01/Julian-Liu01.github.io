                <h2>Take-home Message</h2>
                <p>
                    In the end of the essay, the author pointed out that during this period
                    people should pay more attention about <q>self care</q> and <q>mental health</q>.
                    The author also share some methods that can help people stay away from psychological
                    distress, including <q>mindful meditation</q> or <q>journaling</q>. Those events let us <q>move
                    our minds off what is stressing us and into the moment</q>.
                    That is why the author quote the advice of Dr. Duffy:
                    <span style="background-color:#80cdc1;">It's also important to engage in activities you
                    used to enjoy before you felt distressed and set aside dedicated time for self-care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="quote">
                    <q>
                        "The focus it takes to list each of these things is often just enough focus to
                        move our minds off what is stressing us and into the moment," said Breland-Noble, who
                        was not involved in the study.It's also important to engage in activities you used to
                        enjoy before you felt distressed and set aside dedicated time for self-care, Duffy said.
                        Some examples of self-care include journaling, walking with a friend or watching a favorite
                        television show, he said.If anyone continues to struggle with their mental health, Duffy
                        recommended they seek professional mental health support such as counseling.
