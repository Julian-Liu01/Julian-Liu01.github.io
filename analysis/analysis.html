                    <span style="background-color:#80cdc1;">It's also important to engage in activities you

                    <q>
                        "The focus it takes to list each of these things is often just enough focus to
                        move our minds off what is stressing us and into the moment," said Breland-Noble, who
                        was not involved in the study.It's also important to engage in activities you used to
                        enjoy before you felt distressed and set aside dedicated time for self-care, Duffy said.
                        Some examples of self-care include journaling, walking with a friend or watching a favorite
                        television show, he said.If anyone continues to struggle with their mental health, Duffy
                        recommended they seek professional mental health support such as counseling.
